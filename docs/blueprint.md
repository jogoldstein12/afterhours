# **App Name**: GlowUp: After Hours

## Core Features:

- Player Setup: Enable users to enter names for all players, before the core gameplay can start.
- Randomizer: Use game decks populated with challenges, questions, or other interactive prompts. Ensure that prompts shown to the user are chosen at random from the currently active deck.
- Game Mode: Support "Pass-the-Phone" gameplay, so users can physically pass the phone.
- Content Filter: Enable the ability to select NSFW level, to allow filtering content. Options include `Mild`, `Medium`, and `Extreme`.
- Game Screen: Clearly indicate current player and display current prompt. Provide "next player" button.
- Content Moderator: Tool that examines pending user-submitted prompts and generates a rating of the suitability of that content given the selected "NSFW" filter; if the rating exceeds a threshold, route the item to the moderation queue.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated violet (#BE52F2) to match the nightclub and neon aesthetic.
- Background color: Very dark violet (#0A040F) for a dark mode aesthetic.
- Accent color: Saturated pink (#F252A9), a closely analogous color to violet, for call to action and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy look that fits the visual styling. Longer text can default to Inter if needed.
- Use minimalist icons appropriate for representing the content of each prompt.
- Provide simple, smooth transition animations between turns.
